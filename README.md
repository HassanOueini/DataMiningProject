# DataMiningProject

This project was done for a class in TMU Computer Science. It  was done to showcase skills we learnt during the term of the class. We had to find a data sample online then manipluate the data to showcase its properties via graphs, then estimate a fake sample using regression. My choice of data was based around real estate properties with 13 variables and over 500 samples. The full dataset can be found in the Housing.csv file.
